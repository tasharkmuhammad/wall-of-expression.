        Fleet Block connects to larger questions about public space and community visibility. The Wall of Expression responds by proposing
        a values-driven space centered on justice, equity, belonging, and collective healing.

        The Salt Lake City Arts Council’s Public Art Program, in collaboration with Salt Lake City Public Lands, the Mayor’s Office, and project stakeholders, is commissioning an artist or artist-led team to create a significant public artwork for the Fleet Block Open Space. This artwork should reflect values articulated through extensive community engagement, including justice, equity, belonging, and collective healing. The selected artist will also help define a conceptual framework for future artworks by other community artists to be commissioned separately by Salt Lake City.
